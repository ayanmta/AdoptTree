General Content Notes for AI:
Tone: Warm, authentic, respectful, innovative, educational.
Keywords: Integrate relevant keywords naturally (e.g., organic farm, Himalayas, sustainable farming, agritech, AI in agriculture, virtual tour, tree adoption, Himachal Pradesh, eco-tourism).
Calls-to-Action: Ensure clear and visually prominent calls-to-action throughout the site.
Visual Integration: Use placeholders for images and videos with descriptions of the desired content (e.g., stunning landscape photos, close-ups of crops, team photos, illustrations).
Data Presentation: For tech sections (tree adoption, AI), use clean visuals like infographics, simple charts, or interactive elements to present data clearly. 
This detailed content structure, combined with the design and tech specifications, provides a comprehensive brief for generating the website. 

Based on the provided b-egg.farm CSS and previous requirements:
Grid System: Implement a flexible grid system (similar to .w-layout-grid) to ensure structured and responsive content layout across all pages.
Responsive Typography: Utilize vw units for font sizes and line heights (for H1-H5 and body text) to maintain readability and aesthetic appeal across devices. Use a blend of an elegant serif font for headings (like "Summer Loving Sans" but consider a more organic/retro alternative) and a clean sans-serif for body text, adapting the font-size and line-height principles from the example.
Hero Section: Design a prominent hero section (like .hero_section) for the homepage, covering 100vh and using position: sticky; top: 0;. Center content within this section, potentially using a slightly off-white or light beige background color from the farm palette. Incorporate parallax effects within this section for the Himalayan landscape and farm visuals.
Content Containers: Create reusable container classes (similar to .container) to constrain content width, ensuring readability. Use variations for different content needs (e.g., full width, centered text, image left/right).
Fixed Navigation: Implement a fixed navigation bar (position: fixed; top: 0;) with a subtle backdrop-filter: blur(), using a background color from the organic palette (e.g., rgba(251, 249, 241, 0) or a soft cream tint). Ensure it is responsive and contains the logo, main navigation links (Explore, About, Products, Contact), and potentially icons for Tree Adoption/Virtual Tour.
Section Styling: Structure the website using distinct sections (like .section) for content blocks (About Us, Products, Tree Adoption, etc.). Use background colors and gradients from the defined palette (deep forest green, warm terracotta, sunrise orange, soft cream) to differentiate sections and create visual interest.
Scroll Effects: Implement subtle scroll-based animations and transitions, drawing inspiration from apple.com/siri/. Integrate parallax scrolling and layered effects for visually engaging storytelling, particularly for the homepage's Himalayan landscape transition and tech integration reveals. Use sticky elements (like .container._90vw) for key features like the Tree Adoption overview.
Imagery: Prioritize high-quality photography and hand-drawn illustrations. Design imagery and layout to tell a story (similar to b-egg.farm's product focus). Ensure responsive image sizing.
Deep Tech Integration Visuals: Design distinct sections/pages for the Virtual Tour and AI Assistant. The Virtual Tour should use interactive 360Â° views with clickable hotspots. The AI Assistant interface should be intuitive and visually blend with the retro-organic theme.
Performance: Ensure the generated code is optimized for fast loading and mobile-first experience, minimizing unnecessary assets and code bloat. 
By providing these specific instructions, the AI should be able to leverage the provided CSS as a foundation and adapt its principles to construct a website that aligns perfectly with your vision for the Himalayan Horizon Farm.
